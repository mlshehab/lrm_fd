# Learning Reward Machines From Demonstrations

This project is a continuation of our framework of learning reward machines from optimal policies. In this work, we relax that requirement, and work with a finite number of demonstrations instead.

Create a virtual environment and activate it using:
```bash
cd ./lrm_fd
conda env create -f lrm.yml -n lrm
conda activate lrm
```
